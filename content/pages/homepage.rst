`bpython` is a fancy interface to the Python interpreter for Linux, BSD, OS X
and Windows (with some work). `bpython` is released under the MIT License. It has
the following (special) features:

* In-line syntax highlighting
* Readline-like autocomplete with suggestions displayed as you type.
* Expected parameter list for any Python function.
* "Rewind" function to pop the last line of code from memory and re-evaluate.
* Send the code you've entered off to a pastebin.
* Save the code you've entered to a file.
* Auto-indentation.
* Python 3 support.

A special thanks to the `Recurse Center`_ who decided to devote a team of young
developers to work on bpython as part of their training programme. They're based
in New York City and have a great attitude towards the development of programmers
of all genders and backgrounds - take a look.
